/**
 * Called as the final step in the processing order.
 *
 * It is recommended that you implement this method as a class method and assign (id)[self class]
 * to the processorDelegate member of the NIProcessorHTTPRequest instance. For example:
 *
 * @code
 *  request.delegate = (id)[self class];
 *
 *  + (id)processor:(id)processor processObject:(id)object error:(NSError **)processingError {
 *    // Now, by design, we can't access self which is often not thread safe.
 *  }
 * @endcode
 *
 * This is because the delegate methods will be called from the NIProcessorHTTPRequest thread -
 * not the main thread - so you must be careful not to touch any non thread-safe data.
 *
 *      @param processor        The object that initiated the call to this method.
 *      @param object           The latest object in the processing pipeline.
 *      @param processingError  The latest error that has occurred in the processing pipeline.
